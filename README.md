An exercise for MVP pattern~ also using the RSS parse with SAX~  NOT FINISHED YET=„ÄÅ=

<h2 style="font-color:#ff7d7d">Problem</h2>
  <li>Problem 1:(solved)</li>
    <p>WHY DOES THIS CODE NOT WORK ?! </p><br />
    <code>InputStream mInputStream = urlc.getInputStream();</code>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no exception...only can be seen through the logcat...</p>
    <strong>Because we COULD NOT using a delay operator in the main thread, which exactly the NET CONNECTION is.</strong>
    <br />
  <li>Problem 2:</li>
    <p>About Bundle transform between the two Activity...</p>
    <p>Actually I know how to receive the parameter in the normal way...but not in this mvp pattern...= =So sad.</p>
    <p><strong>WHERE</strong> Should I get that bundle ?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SOLVE:</strong>&nbsp;We could put the methods about set or get Bundle in the View part.And then using them through the function of the presenter by invoke...At least I think it should be like this...
